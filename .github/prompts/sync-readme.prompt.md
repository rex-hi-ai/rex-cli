**You are a Senior Developer responsible for maintaining project documentation.** Your task is to perform a comprehensive update of the project's `README.md` file to ensure it is accurate, up-to-date, and provides maximum value to both new and existing contributors.

---

### **Phase 1: Audit & Preparation**

1.  **Review Recent Changes:**
    * Scan the commit history (`git log`) for major features, dependency updates, or breaking changes since the last README update.

2.  **Verify Core Dependencies:**
    * **Goal:** Review the project's primary dependency files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`) to ensure any libraries or versions mentioned in the README are accurate.
    * **Tip:** Commands like `npm list --depth=0` or `pip list` can be used as a quick way to list dependencies for comparison.

### **Phase 2: Content Update & Verification**

Execute the following checklist, updating each section of the `README.md` as needed.

* **[ ] Project Title & Subtitle:**
    * Confirm the project name is correct and the subtitle concisely describes its core purpose.

* **[ ] Badges & Status Indicators:**
    * Review all status badges (Build, Coverage, Version, etc.). Hover over them to ensure their tooltips and links are correct.

* **[ ] Project Description:**
    * Refine the description to reflect the project's current value proposition, key features, and target audience. Remove any outdated information.

* **[ ] Table of Contents (TOC):**
    * If one exists, ensure it is in sync with the document's structure. Confirm all internal links navigate correctly.

* **[ ] Installation Guide:**
    * **Crucial:** From a clean state, execute the installation steps exactly as written.
    * Edit commands, version requirements, or environment variable instructions (`.env.example`) to resolve any errors or inconsistencies.

* **[ ] Usage / Quick Start:**
    * Run the primary code snippets and usage examples.
    * Update any examples that are broken due to API changes. Ensure code is clear and easy to copy.

* **[ ] Configuration Details:**
    * Review the documented environment variables or config file options.
    * Verify that defaults are correct and that required vs. optional settings are clearly distinguished.

* **[ ] Test Execution:**
    * Run the documented test commands. Confirm they execute the correct test suite(s) and that the instructions are clear.

* **[ ] Contribution & Licensing:**
    * Check that the links to `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `LICENSE` files are valid.
    * Briefly review the contribution guidelines to ensure they still reflect the team's preferred workflow.

### **Phase 3: Finalization & Polish**

1.  **Link Validation:**
    * **Action:** Validate the hyperlinks within the document.
    * **Recommendation:** Use your code editor's built-in extensions (e.g., link checkers) for efficiency. Alternatively, spot-check the most critical external links.

2.  **Proofread & Formatting Review:**
    * **Action:** Correct any spelling or grammatical errors.
    * **Recommendation:** Leverage your editor's spell-check functionality. Use the Markdown preview feature to ensure formatting is clean and consistent.
